            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>Dazed and confused after a record-chasing battle with Izta (read the trip report on that one!), it
                    was time for the
                    kingpin of my Mexico expedition. Though I could surely hear him before I could see him, I stepped
                    outside just
                    in time to watch
                    Ilgamesh arrive at my hotel in his rickety old pickup truck.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2.5-hour drive eastward
                    toward
                    Mexico's
                    highest peak was filled with all sorts of chaotic stories, and conversation alternated between
                    English and
                    Spanish at what seemed like just the perfect cadence. As we progressed, I monitored the ever-growing
                    silhouette of what
                    would become one of the most challenging climbs of my life.</p>

                <h3>Into the Unknown</h3>
                <p>We stopped for a meal at a family-run hostel in Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla before transferring to a
                    beast of a 4WD off-roader for the
                    ascent to Refugio. I hopped in the lifted Jeep and quickly realized... no seatbelts? Mexico truly
                    plays by
                    their own rules. As we bucked every-which-way up the
                    dusty mountain roads, I laughed to myself. This was happening, I was really doing this.
                </p>

                <p>At the Refugio, we met Ahmed, a young guide who would be our basecamp support, cooking us meals, and
                    serving as our safety net if the summit push didn't go as planned. After he whipped up some
                    delicious
                    rice
                    and beans, we crashed at 6 PM, listening to the whipping wind rattle the frame of the Refugio. I
                    drifted off knowing that in just
                    seven hours, I'd be starting my
                    attempt on North America's tallest volcano.</p>

                <h3>The Battle Begins</h3>
                <p>1 AM crept up quickly. Ahmed had us covered, with eggs and hot water Nalgene refills as our last
                    comforts before
                    stepping into the
                    cold darkness of the night. We followed el acueducto past the 3 nests without concern. These were
                    our first
                    indicators of being on-route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We entered Laberinto (the Labyrinth), where many esteemed mountaineers get lost and turn back.
                    Ilgamesh had me covered. Every step of this mountain was familiar to him, and he moved gracefully as
                    though the entire act was rehearsed. We popped on glacier gear by the Sarcofago (the Sarcophagus),
                    and off we went up the Jamapa Glacier, held together by nothing more than an 8mm rope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was here on the glacier, completely exposed to the elements, that Type I fun began gravitating
                    toward
                    Type II.
                    While focusing on the criticality of foot placement in this crevasse minefield, we were barraged by
                    Mother Nature's worst. Sustained 45 mph winds with gusts over 50 mph turned the mountain into a
                    frozen
                    battlefield. But we continued, onward and upward.</p>
                </p>
                <p>My hands were losing the fight. The liner gloves and ski mittens that had carried me through
                    countless
                    previous expeditions
                    were completely inadequate against Pico's fury. Frostbite was creeping in quickly when Ilgamesh
                    showed me a
                    mountaineer's secret: unzip your shell slightly and shove your hands under your armpits. Hold them
                    there, through all of the extreme burning sensations, and you will regain feeling. It was a
                    game-changer that likely saved my fingers.</p>

                <h3>Dawn at 18,491 Feet</h3>
                <p>We reached the crater rim just as the first light spread across the horizon. Finding shelter from the
                    relentless wind, we watched the sun rise over a sea of clouds that stretched into infinity below us.
                    At first, it seemed that the worst was over, that we had braved the storm.
                    But
                    the altitude was taking its toll - I felt myself nodding off, fighting an eerie drowsiness that
                    signals the early stages of altitude sickness. It didn't take long for us to pack up our gear and
                    head back onto the glacier.</p>

                <p>To our surprise, the descent brought only relief, as the sun emerged and temperatures rose. We
                    navigated
                    past crevasses, large
                    and small,
                    around the glacier - reminders of the technical terrain we'd navigated in darkness. By the time we
                    reached
                    base camp, Pico released us from its grip. We'd finally made peace with the giant.
                </p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>The ride back to town felt surreal. We had done it ‚Äî summited the highest
                    peak in Mexico, battled extreme weather, and staved off altitude sickness in the process. Pico de
                    Orizaba was one
                    to
                    remember.</p>
