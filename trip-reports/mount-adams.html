            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>I linked up with Raffi in Seattle and we made the drive south to the Mount Adams South Climb
                    Trail. Dinner was Costco chicken skewers at the trailhead, followed by cowboy camping next to
                    our cars. This pattern was becoming more routine for me.</p>

                <h3>The Push</h3>
                <p>We woke at 2:30 AM and began our ascent. The first two and a half hours were on trail, and we
                    reached Crescent Glacier by 5 AM. Crampons on, we pushed up to the Lunch Counter by 6:30. Most
                    people do this climb as a two-day adventure, camping out at the Lunch Counter overnight. We just
                    blasted right past it and kept going.</p>

                <p>The sun was getting brighter and the snow softer as we climbed higher. We finally hit the summit
                    around 11 AM. We were stoked. Raffi was really feeling it though, and it would only get worse on
                    the way down.</p>

                <h3>The Great Glissade</h3>
                <p>Thankfully, Mount Adams is known for its glissading. Instead of grinding out a long descent on
                    tired legs, we slid down hundreds — if not thousands — of feet. It was amazing. The mountain
                    that had taken us hours to climb was giving us a free ride back down.</p>

                <p>Raffi finally hit a bonk around halfway down. We stopped and he chugged a caffeinated,
                    carb-loaded mix. That would hopefully be enough to get him off the mountain safely.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>It worked. We reached the parking lot by 5 PM. Quite a long day out there, but tons of fun and a
                    great intro to mountaineering for Raffi — or as he'd call it, a "steep walk." The glissading
                    alone made this one worth it.</p>
