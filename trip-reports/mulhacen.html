            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>Back to Spain for a work trip, and I wasn't about to waste the weekend. I landed at 11 PM on Friday,
                    grabbed my rental car at midnight, and headed straight for Toledo. I got lost driving around the
                    hilly, old-style roads, but finally made it to my hotel.
                    A couple hours of sleep, and the weekend adventure began.</p>

                <h3>Mission #1: Toledo to Trevélez</h3>
                <p>A 5.5-hour drive south through Castilla y León and into Andalusia. I watched as the vast swaths of
                    farmland and arid steppe became more and more mountainous.
                    I stocked up on trail mix, water, and a jar of honey at a local grocery store, but found that most
                    gas stations didn't accept card. Uh oh. Eventually
                    found a BP in the middle of nowhere that accepted card, filled up the tank, and got into the
                    hills of the Sierra Nevada — the Spanish Sierra, not California.</p>

                <p>The windy mountain roads and hill-scattered towns were absolutely gorgeous. I'd love to bike
                    here. Got to Trevélez at 3 PM — only 6 hours until sunset.</p>

                <h3>Mission #2: Summit Mulhacén</h3>
                <p>I got to the trailhead of the highest mountain in Spain with limited daylight left. It was time
                    to send. I slammed some honey straight from the jar and I was off.</p>

                <p>Since I only had flasks and no bladder, I threw my Nalgene in the back of my vest along with my
                    wind shell. Both of these things came in clutch.</p>

                <p>To make it the full 15.5 miles and 6,600 feet of elevation gain before sunset, I had to push. Along
                    the way I saw some ibex that
                    looked like mountain goats, crossed gorgeous snow fields, and looked out over the Mediterranean to
                    Africa!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I finally climbed the snowy outcrop at the top to reach the summit. The views of the surrounding
                    Sierra were so beautiful, and so much more snow than at sea level! At the top, I met a dude named
                    Raúl — a local who skis all of these peaks. Mulhacén is his
                    favorite.</p>

                <p>
                    My descent was speedy but controlled. I did some sliding down the snow-covered north aspects, and
                    hopped my way through multiple river crossings.
                    My Nalgene was my only remaining source of water, as I didn't have a filter with me on this
                    adventure. By mile 14, I was running low on honey and water, but I continued to push my way through
                    the farms and around the cows to get myself back to the car. I had arrived, minutes before sunset.
                </p>

                <h3>Mission #3: Food and Sleep</h3>
                <p>Back in town, I headed to a local spot and got some jamon iberico and pulpo — exactly the salty,
                    fatty fuel I
                    needed. Then I got back in the car and drove an hour to the nearest beach town. Found a cheap hotel
                    with free parking, parked the car, then
                    zonked. It felt amazing to finally sleep after a crazy long day.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>Woke up at 10 AM in Salobreña, and MAN it was a whole different world in the daylight. I walked down
                    to the beach and dipped
                    my feet in the Mediterranean. Perfect temperature. The place was gorgeous — massive, snowcapped
                    mountains right up
                    against the coast. I wished I could spend the whole week here, but I needed to get back up north for
                    work on Monday.

                <p>Drove 3.75 hours back to Toledo, legs totally shot, munching on trail mix
                    the whole way. I enjoyed my evening here and prepped for the work week. What an awesome way to spend
                    my weekend in Spain.</p>
