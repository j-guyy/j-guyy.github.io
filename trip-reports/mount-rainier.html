            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>We were off to a rocky start. I had just gotten back from Asia and was completely
                    jetlagged — so jetlagged, in fact, that I slept through my Denver to Seattle flight. By the time
                    I landed, it was 1:30 PM, and Mason, Chris, and Bobby had been waiting at the
                    airport for a while. The rental car was in my name, so they weren't able to progress without me.</p>

                <p>By the time we got the car and started heading out of the city, we realized there was no way we
                    were making it to the Paradise ranger station in time to pick up our mountaineering permits. That
                    was the first pivot. It wouldn't be the last.</p>

                <h3>Pivoting</h3>
                <p>We had originally planned a Saturday ascent, but absurd snowfall was in the forecast, so we
                    decided to climb on Friday instead. And since we'd missed the ranger station, and the snow was
                    coming the next day, our only option was to go car-to-car — the full climb in one push, no
                    stopping at Camp Muir on the way up.</p>

                <p>We called Harvard Harry on our way out there. His advice was simple: just listen to what the
                    guides are doing for the guided groups, and follow their lead when in doubt.</p>

                <h3>Into the Night</h3>
                <p>We slept at a campground right outside the park from 6 PM to 9 PM, then headed into Mount Rainier
                    National Park and began climbing from Paradise at 11 PM. Almost immediately, the rental
                    mountaineering boots
                    that Bobby, Chris, and Mason had picked up started causing problems. The quality was terrible,
                    and the pain was real.</p>

                <p>Bobby and Chris made the call to turn around at Camp Muir. The boot issues were just too much.
                    I understood the call, but it threw off our rope team. Mason and I continued above Muir roped just
                    to each other, being
                    especially careful around crevasses with only two on the line.</p>

                <h3>The Disappointment Cleaver</h3>
                <p>We made it across the Cowlitz Glacier, through the Cathedral Gap, over the Ingraham Flats, under
                    the Ingraham Icefall, and up onto the Disappointment Cleaver. The route was not super technical, and
                    we
                    were moving well.</p>

                <p>On the Cleaver, we passed some guides coming down. I picked their brains. The news wasn't great:
                    lenticular turbulence. The lenticular cloud sitting on the summit wasn't going anywhere, and
                    inside it, conditions were brutal. Mason and I continued our ascent anyway, passing group after
                    group coming down. Nobody had made it through the cloud to the summit.</p>

                <h3>The Decision</h3>
                <p>We broke past the top of the Cleaver and headed back onto the glacier. Massive suncups surrounded
                    us — an eerie, beautiful sight. But once inside the lenticular cloud, visibility dropped
                    dramatically and conditions worsened fast.</p>

                <p>Then came the real problem. Two weeks before our permit date, the DC route we'd been planning to
                    follow had been wiped out by a massive icefall. The only way past it would be to climb the
                    icefall itself. In these low-visibility conditions, that was too sketchy.</p>

                <p>So I listened to the guides, and turned us around. Mason wasn't happy, but conditions only got
                    worse as we descended — until we finally broke out of the cloud. We had made the right
                    call.</p>

                <h3>The Descent</h3>
                <p>Mason and I made it back down and linked up with Chris and Bobby at the bottom. We crashed at
                    Chris' sister Megan's place for the night — a much-needed recovery after the long push.</p>

                <p>On our way out of the national park, we stopped for dinner at the same place we'd eaten on the
                    way in: Wildberry Restaurant, an epic Nepalese spot. A fitting bookend to a trip that didn't go
                    as planned, but gave us quite the story.</p>

                <h3>Unfinished Business</h3>
                <p>Rainier won this round. But the mountain isn't going anywhere, and neither am I.</p>
