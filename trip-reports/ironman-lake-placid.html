            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>Sunday, July 28th, 2019. Today was the day.</p>

                <p>I woke up at 3am with that familiar mix of excitement and nerves that comes before a big race. The
                    kind of morning where your body knows something significant is about to happen, even before your
                    mind fully catches up.</p>

                <h3>Pre-Race Rituals</h3>
                <p>I got ready and headed to breakfast in the hotel kitchen, where I met Andrew and Cassandra. We ate
                    and talked nervously about the race - we were all ready to go, but that pre-race energy was
                    palpable. There's something comforting about sharing those final moments with fellow athletes who
                    understand exactly what you're feeling.</p>

                <p>Brett drove the three of us to the race site, and I wandered with my two new friends to the special
                    needs drop-offs and then to body marking. The ritual of getting your race number written on your
                    arms and legs always makes it feel real - there's no backing out now.</p>

                <h3>Getting in the Zone</h3>
                <p>I headed into transition and set up my gear in a way that was curated only to me. Unlike previous
                    races, the transitions here were done with transition bags, rather than laying everything out by the
                    bike. I organized everything inside my transition bags the same way as I always did - my socks were
                    rolled up inside my bike
                    shoes, my gels were in little baggies divided by type, my padded bike shorts ready to be put on over
                    my trisuit. I put on
                    my
                    headphones and cranked up the EDM, the same routine as
                    always.</p>

                <p>I got hyped and headed down to the swim start while "Overkill" by RIOT blasted in my ears. After
                    waiting in a ridiculous line just to use the bathroom and put my tri gear on, I headed to the
                    tennis courts to squeeze into my wetsuit, then weaved through the crowd to get to my age group. It
                    was go time.</p>

                <h3>The Swim: Battle in Mirror Lake</h3>
                <p>The race began, and the swim immediately degraded into an all-out brawl. Everyone who knew the course
                    knew that there was only one ideal position: directly over the underwater cable that marked the
                    course direction. If you could get over that, you wouldn't need to lift your head to sight, saving
                    energy throughout
                    the entire swim. I battled my way through elbows, legs, people pulling others, people pushing
                    others, but landed in position, right over the cable. Things were going perfectly.</p>

                <h3>T1: Controlled Chaos</h3>
                <p>Transition 1 was a blur of soaking wet athletes stripping out of wetsuits and grabbing bikes. The
                    volunteers were doing whatever they could to help. I raced out to the drop bag area and volunteers
                    ran out to grab me my bag. Everything was handed to me, and I quickly got ready to go; the clock
                    always ticking.</p>

                <h3>The Bike: Through the Adirondacks</h3>
                <p>The bike leg was where the real adventure began. With the incredible Adirondack
                    scenery surrounding me, I enjoyed the continuous rolling hills of the High Peaks region. I kept my
                    carbohydrate
                    intake consistent, and hydrated the whole way. It was an overcast day, fresh off of a rain storm, so
                    roads were slick but temperatures were low. The first 56 miles were a breeze.</p>
                <p>
                    At the halfway mark, there was an aid station deemed Special Needs. This was where you could prepare
                    a gearbag drop for yourself ahead of time, to resupply midway through the ride. In theory this was
                    great - direct
                    access to a refuel. But upon arrival, I realized it was a whole lot more chaotic than expected... I
                    had been fueling on Infinit and RXBars the entire race thus far, but had a sandwich waiting for me
                    at Special Needs. As the volunteers scrambled to find my bag, and people were blocking each other in
                    on their bikes, I was so ready to enjoy that PB and J.
                    Welp, no more than 1 minute out of Special Needs, I dropped my sandwich. Gone forever, no going back
                    now.
                </p>

                <h3>T2: The Final Transition</h3>
                <p>Finishing the ride was a relief, and gave me time for a quick bathroom break before tackling the run.
                    My legs felt heavy from the bike, but I was still amped up and ready to go. How hard could a
                    marathon really be? I wouldn't know, as I never ran one before race day.</p>

                <h3>The Run: When Reality Hits</h3>
                <p>The run started strong, as it always does. Fresh legs, crowd support, and the excitement of being on
                    the final leg. But that strength fizzled as the miles accumulated and reality set in. By mile 13, I
                    was slowing down, and by mile 20, I was being passed by some fast walkers. I couldn't let myself
                    walk, though. I trucked on at the slowest pace imaginable, as the KT tape on my knees unraveled more
                    and more and the happy thoughts started to fade.</p>
                <p>I think a volunteer could see my pain, because some dude ran up to me and asked, "Hey man, want a
                    salt lick?" At first I thought I was totally imagining this, but surely enough, this guy then hands
                    me a small plastic tube. "What is this?" I asked back, to which he demonstrated with a second tube.
                    Shake the vial, lick your finger, and pour salt on it. The salt sticks to your finger, and you take
                    a big old lick of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. The purest form of electrolytes.
                </p>
                <p>I continued through the final 6 miles on a second wind. I was accounting for carb intake, but was I
                    not doing a good enough job on electrolytes? Mayhaps not, but as soon as my blood salinity was back
                    in check, it was off to the races.
                </p>

                <h3>The Finish Line</h3>
                <p>I could feel the presence of the finish line. The crowds around the race went from few and far
                    between, to everywhere around you. Entering back into the town of Lake Placid was something magical.
                    The sights, the sounds, the energy; everything was just calling you toward your final steps of the
                    race.</p>
                <p>
                    Turning the final corner and sprinting through that finish line in Lake Placid was a moment that's
                    impossible to fully describe.
                    The
                    relief, the accomplishment, and the sheer disbelief that you've just completed 140.6 miles under
                    your
                    own power.</p>

                <h3>Post-Race Reality</h3>
                <p>Immediately after the race, my memory started to go. I remember walking to the banana stand, grabbing
                    a banana, then curling in a ball with an insulated blanket wrapped around me. I could hear the
                    faded voices of my family members, asking if I was okay...</p>
                <p>
                    As I laid there, drifting through a state of semi-consiousness, I wondered. Was I okay? I was, yes;
                    I was more than okay. After 3 years
                    of training, I had just completed the biggest athletic challenge of my life.
