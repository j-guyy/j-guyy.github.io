            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>This adventure did not go as expected, but I still made the best of it.</p>

                <p>I was coming off a work trip in China and hopped a flight to Jeju-do, an island off the south
                    coast of South Korea — basically the Korean Hawaii. I came here for one reason: this is where
                    the country high point is.</p>

                <h3>Getting Settled</h3>
                <p>Fresh off the work trip, laundry was priority number one. Step one: go to a bank and withdraw
                    local currency. Step two: go to the grocery store and pay in won — get change in coins. Step
                    three: use the coins from the grocery store to pay for laundry. After those three steps, I was
                    ready to roll.</p>

                <p>I rented a road bike and stayed at a hotel right on the water. I used my bike to get around, and
                    found
                    an awesome outdoor gym right nearby my hotel. My first day in Jeju was spent just taking it all in.
                </p>

                <h3>The Night Before</h3>
                <p>The night before my birthday, I headed into a small seafood restaurant right on the water's
                    edge. The people working there didn't speak any English, so I pointed to the fish I wanted on
                    the menu, but told them I couldn't afford what was listed. They still set me up with whatever
                    I was willing to pay for.</p>

                <p>I asked the owner, using Google Translate, if she gets a lot of Americans in there. She said no,
                    very rarely. I stuffed myself with excellent fresh fish and called it a night.</p>

                <h3>Birthday Morning</h3>
                <p>The plan for my birthday was ambitious: dip my rental bike tire in the East China Sea, bike the
                    8 miles and 1,900 feet of gain up to the Halla-san trailhead, stash the bike, hike the
                    remaining 4,500 feet to the summit, then cruise back down to the sea on two wheels. Sea to
                    summit and back. Everything was slated to work. Until it wasn't.</p>

                <p>I woke up at 4 AM and discovered a pinch flat in my bike tire. The bike shop wasn't open yet, so I
                    couldn't rush there to get a new tube.
                    I tried to call a Kakao taxi to bring me to the trailhead, but
                    nothing was nearby. So I strapped on my running vest and began running on the road uphill toward the
                    base of the
                    mountain. Eventually
                    I made it to downtown where I could hail a taxi. The driver brought me up to the Halla-san
                    trailhead just in time for my timed entry into the park — I only had a two-hour window during
                    which I could enter.</p>

                <h3>The Climb</h3>
                <p>I climbed Halla-san in brutal heat. It was beautiful and lush, with large vertical cliffs jutting up
                    above the forest. The trail was well marked and there were a surprising number of people up there.
                    Looking into the volcano's crater at the summit was very cool, and then it was onto the descent!
                    New country high point, check.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>After descending from the summit and returning to the trailhead, I grabbed a taxi back to my hotel
                    and then it was time to relax.
                    I also made my way to
                    the bike shop that evening to get my tube replaced. Such a bummer that that part didn't work out.
                    Looking back at the climb, it was definitely
                    not the hardest mountain
                    I've climbed, nor the most unique mountain challenge, but it was still a birthday adventure to
                    remember.</p>

                <p>But the Jeju trip wasn't over. The bike was fixed, and the island was calling —
                    <a href="#">time to ride around Jeju</a>.
