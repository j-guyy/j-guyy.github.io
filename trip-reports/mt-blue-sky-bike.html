            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>Biked up Mt Blue Sky with Harvard Harry. The highest paved road in North America. I rode Tony,
                    Harry rode a rental bike. We knew the road was going to be closed off to traffic at the end of
                    summer for repaving, so this was our last chance to climb it.</p>

                <h3>The Rental Bike Saga</h3>
                <p>Getting the rental bike for Harry was chaotic. He wasn't going to make it to Frisco before the
                    stores closed, so I got sized and hopped between bike shops to get all of the pieces he'd need.
                    We found out that Harry and I have the same size legs, so when I was sized, the measurements
                    also applied to him.</p>

                <p>I finished up my summit of <a href="colorado-14ers.html">Oxford and Belford</a> with Danny
                    Paul, then headed to Frisco to grab Harry's rental bike. His timing wasn't working out, so I
                    ended up getting sized on the bike instead of him. He also needed bike shoes, so I bought him
                    some — except they didn't come with cleats. So I was running around Frisco at 5 PM on a
                    Saturday just hoping to find an open bike shop that had SPD-SL cleats. Thankfully, the last
                    shop in town that I checked, Rebel Sports on Main St, had exactly what we needed.</p>

                <p>I grabbed the stuff and linked up with Harry. We made our way to Idaho Springs, where we cowboy
                    camped in a parking lot.</p>

                <h3>The Climb</h3>
                <p>The next morning, at the crack of dawn, we loaded up our pockets and hopped on our bikes. Harry
                    was riding this awesome, freshly tuned carbon fiber road bike, and I was chugging along on
                    honest Tony — an 8-year-old aluminum road bike that was desperately overdue for a tuneup. The
                    sound of the chain grinding was so bad that Harry refused to keep riding next to me, and rode
                    ahead to be out of earshot of that horrendous sound.</p>

                <p>The climb was slow and long, but really not steep. Honestly, it was such an ideal way to ride
                    into the alpine without totally burning out in the first mile. We passed a parking lot at
                    around 12,000 feet, where we saw mountain goats licking the bottoms of parked cars. Salt? We
                    filtered some water at a lake and kept going, all the way up to the top of the highest paved
                    road in North America.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>When we hit the summit, we took in the views, ate some snacks, and got our picture taken. This
                    was so perfect. But as some spooky looking clouds rolled in and a drizzle of rain began, we
                    knew it was time to go. I realized I had a pinch flat, so I replaced my tube at the summit,
                    then we began the most exciting descent I think I've ever had.</p>

                <p>Due to the nature of the low-grade road, we hit our terminal velocity relatively early and just
                    coasted at that. No braking required, no pedaling required. The rain began to pick up a bit
                    more as we progressed, but we didn't mind — we were having a blast. We finally made it back to
                    our cars, where we tried to recreate the picture from the morning. What an awesome
                    adventure.</p>
