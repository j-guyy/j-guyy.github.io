            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>The best parts of Japan are outside of Tokyo. I took a series of trains from Shibuya all the way
                    out to Fujiyoshida, where my Airbnb host picked me up from the train station.</p>

                <p>The Airbnb in Fujiyoshida didn't have any bed — you sleep on a pad on the floor. No chairs
                    either — you kneel at the table. When in Japan.</p>

                <h3>The Climb</h3>
                <p>I chose this Airbnb due to its proximity to the base of the mountain. I woke up at 1 AM and walked to
                    Station 1 to begin my climb. Most
                    people get a headstart by taking a bus all the way up to Station 5, but I wanted the full
                    experience.</p>

                <p>The first stretch was through a foggy forest in the middle of the night. I saw some deer, and
                    then heard squealing nearby. I turned down my headlamp and watched a boar poke its nose out
                    of the tall grass right next to the trail before it ran back in. That was spooky.</p>

                <h3>Off-Season Rules</h3>
                <p>Technically, I was climbing before the season started, so there was a big gate blocking the
                    trail above the 5th station. Easy enough to walk behind the gate and keep going.</p>

                <p>Further up, I passed a few other people climbing the mountain in off season. I met an old man who
                    claimed to be "Mr. Fuji." He said, "I Mister Fuji, I climb
                    Mount Fuji one thousand time!" I smiled and kept moving. Come to find out later, after looking
                    him up, he's actually an <a href="https://zerofit.com/en/blogs/feature/interview-5"
                        target="_blank">insane mountaineer</a>. </p>

                <h3>To the Top</h3>
                <p>I had brought microspikes, an ice axe, and crampons just in case — none of them were needed.
                    The snow was minimal and the route was clean. I fueled the whole way on rice balls and jellies
                    from the local 7-Eleven. Japan's convenience stores are unreal.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>Summited Fuji as the morning light filled the sky. The snow was still deep inside the crater, and I
                    could see some skin tracks and turns. Someone must have brought their backcountry skis... man that
                    would be cool.

                    I enjoyed the view for a few minutes, then ran the whole way down along dirt
                    switchbacks, letting gravity do the work. I made it back to the Airbnb around 11am, stumbled in, and
                    crashed on the sleeping pad. What a time.</p>
