            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>I was working in Sydney for a few weeks, and one of my weekends was spent in the Snowy Mountains
                    of the Great Dividing Range. Destination: Mount Kosciuszko, the Australia high point.</p>

                <h3>Thredbo Closing Day</h3>
                <p>Snow was present but not terrible — sounds like this year was a very low snow winter for them,
                    which worked out in my favor since I had no flotation, just microspikes. I started the climb
                    from the Thredbo ski resort, which had very little snow. Made it up to the top of the resort
                    to find the liftees throwing a party for closing day.</p>

                <h3>The Kosciuszko Walk</h3>
                <p>I walked along the Kosciuszko Walk, a surprisingly flat footpath, to the base of Kosciuszko
                    proper. This mountain range is so strange — it's steep at the bottom, flat like a plateau up
                    top, with the occasional black rock, snowy peak jutting up. Unlike anything I'd hiked
                    before.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>Got to the top of Kosciuszko and glided my way down the snowy hills. Man, I wish I had brought
                    my backcountry skis for this top part.</p>

                <p>On the way down, I noticed my big toe on my right foot was really starting to feel some pain
                    on the ascents and descents. I decided to start going to PT when I got back to the US, but
                    had no idea what was causing it. Would later find out it was a stress fracture of the
                    sesamoid, get it misdiagnosed as a metatarsal injury, treat it incorrectly for a year, and
                    then need surgery when the stress fracture became a fully fragmented bone. But that's a story
                    for another day.</p>
