            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>I landed in Mexico City hauling a massive 100-liter expedition duffel stuffed with mountaineering
                    gear. First order of business: hit the ATM for some pesos, then grab a taxi to the bus station.</p>

                <p>The chaos inside the Mexico City bus station was something else entirely. I navigated the madness
                    until I found the Autobuses de Oriente (ADO) ticket booth and bought a one-way to Puebla. Making
                    my way to the gate, I quickly realized there was no rhyme or reason to any of it — buses pulling
                    up, buses driving away, and the only way you'd know yours was ready was from the driver barging in
                    and yelling the bus number and departure time to a sea of people in seats. Pure chaos.</p>

                <p>Thankfully, I caught my bus. As we headed east out of the city, I watched the silhouettes of Izta
                    and Popocatépetl grow ever-closer through the window. The mountains were calling.</p>

                <p>A Hilton Governor's Suite was waiting for me in Puebla. Not a bad way to kick off a mountaineering
                    expedition. But the luxury was short-lived — the real adventure was about to begin.</p>

                <h3>The Crew</h3>
                <p>My guides — Patti, Alo, and Ilgamesh — picked me up from the hotel in their truck. Already inside
                    was another American, an ex-Navy man named Frank. Frank and I hit it off immediately, swapping
                    stories the entire ride out to base camp. He does a Central America mountaineering trip every
                    winter,
                    which gave me confidence that I was in good company.</p>

                <p>Once at base camp, Alo took Frank and me on an acclimation hike. Alo held a solid pace, and I was
                    right there with him, but could definitely feel the elevation. Our base camp was at 13,050ft, nearly
                    just as high as the highest peaks in the Rockies. This was going to be an adventure.</p>

                <p>Patti cooked us all a big dinner back at camp, and we crashed at 6 PM. Sleep would be brief.</p>

                <h3>The Midnight Push</h3>
                <p>We woke at midnight, ate a quick breakfast, and stepped into the darkness. Alo and I moved fast —
                    but I felt surprisingly comfortable. Ilgamesh and Frank had started a full 30 minutes before us, but
                    it wasn't long before
                    we were reeling them in. By the time we passed them, our kill count was already over 20 — group
                    after group falling behind as we charged upward through the night. The air was cool, and the wind
                    building, but we were feeling good.</p>

                <h3>Into the Glacier</h3>
                <p>We reached the edge of the Ayoloco (Stomach) Glacier and Alo paused. The wind had picked up
                    significantly,
                    and was now absolutely whipping. He scanned for the best route, unsure if conditions were safe
                    enough to continue. We watched as a few other groups descended into the glacier bed ahead of us.
                    That was enough confirmation. Alo and I roped up to each other and followed them down — a steep,
                    uneven descent that demanded full attention with every step.</p>

                <p>It was still pitch black, and the wind was relentless as we crossed the glacier. Nothing but
                    headlamps, rope tension, and trust between us and the other side. We made it through clean, and
                    from there, it was a straight push to the top.</p>

                <h3>Summit Before Sunrise</h3>
                <p>Alo and I reached the summit well before sunrise. The wind at 17,159 feet was relentless — the kind
                    that makes you question how long you can stay standing. We didn't linger. A few quick moments to
                    take it in, and we turned back down, watching the first light crest across the horizon in the
                    distance.</p>

                <p>The descent rewarded us with something the summit couldn't: a gorgeous sunrise unfolding above the
                    Stomach Glacier. The light spilled across the volcanic landscape in waves of orange and gold, and
                    for a moment, the wind didn't matter.</p>

                <h3>The Way Out</h3>
                <p>The hike out was long but good. I got to practice my Spanish with Alo the whole way down, stumbling
                    through conjugations while he patiently corrected me between laughs. The mountain had tested us, but
                    now it was letting us go easy. Our pace didn't let go at all.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>When we rolled back into base camp, the news was waiting for us. Alo and I had set the course record
                    on the Izta climb. The fastest ascent ever publicly recorded on that route.</p>

                <p>Yeewww!</p>

                <p>But the expedition wasn't over. The very next day, Ilgamesh and I were headed east for the big
                    one — <a href="pico-de-orizaba.html">Pico de Orizaba</a>, the tallest volcano in North America.</p>
