            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>Text from Chris - conditions were supposed to be ideal for a Hood summit push on Tuesday — the summer
                    solstice. So
                    after work on Monday, I headed down to Timberline.</p>

                <p>I linked up with Chris, Harvard Harry, and Michael just before sunset. We ate in the Timberline
                    Lodge parking lot, signed the climbers register, and Chris helped me try on crampons and
                    microspikes for the first time. I had never used any of this gear before. This was my first
                    mountaineering adventure, and I was about to learn on the job.</p>

                <h3>Cowboy Camp</h3>
                <p>We cowboy camped on the ground next to our cars — my first time sleeping under the stars with
                    nothing but a sleeping bag and a sleeping pad. It was brief, but wonderful. We woke at 1 AM and
                    began our
                    push.</p>

                <h3>The Ascent</h3>
                <p>I followed Chris' lead, throwing on microspikes as we reached snow, then switching to crampons
                    at the base of Palmer Glacier. Ice axes were used for balance, and no ropes were needed. The
                    rhythm was simple: plant, step, breathe.</p>

                <p>We made our way up to Crater Rock and crossed a snow bridge over the bergschrund. In late season
                    this would be a major crevasse risk, but this time of year the bridge was sturdy and stable. We
                    continued along the relatively flat Hogsback toward the summit push. Chris was a great guide,
                    careful to point out the fumaroles — volcanic vents — along either side of us. Would not want
                    to fall into one of those.</p>

                <p>The sunrise was turning into daylight, and the sheer beauty of the mountain was becoming more and
                    more vivid. Being my first ever mountaineering adventure, I was blown away by the scale of it
                    all. The mountain's shadow cast along the land below from this high up was unlike anything I'd ever
                    seen.</p>

                <h3>The Pearly Gates</h3>
                <p>Now onto the final push. Crampons and ice axe were a necessity. We started our way up the Pearly
                    Gates, which appeared to be open just enough for us to fit through. Man, that was cool. It was
                    more of a class-3 style climb, using our ice axes to pull ourselves up. Harry was flying ahead
                    while the rest of us took our time, monitoring the terrifying-looking fumaroles directly beneath
                    us.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>As we crested the summit in the sunrise, I saw a beauty I'll never forget. My first look at the
                    Cascade volcanoes from the top of one of them taught me that this sport was everything I was
                    hoping for, and then some. Chris said he had never spent a Mount Hood summit day in such perfect
                    conditions — bright, warm sunlight, and not the slightest breeze.</p>

                <p>We began carefully downclimbing the Pearly Gates, monitoring the icefall we'd have on the people
                    below us. The rest of the descent was smooth sailing, taking in the beautiful day, and even
                    getting some trail running in on the final stretch along the ski slope.</p>

                <p>This adventure, and the time spent at the summit with my friends, inspired me to continue
                    pursuing mountaineering. It was the beginning of everything that followed.</p>
