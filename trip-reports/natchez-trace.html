            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>My first multi-day bike tour. I drove from Houston to Natchez, Mississippi and crashed in town
                    for the night. Woke up the next morning ready to roll. Ate hotel breakfast — eggs. Yikes, first
                    time I'd had animal protein in months.</p>

                <h3>Heading North</h3>
                <p>I drove to Walmart, grabbed the supplies I needed — including a tarp to wrap all my stuff in to
                    keep it dry, since it was supposed to start pouring — and parked the car. It was game time. I
                    grabbed Tony, my clunky-yet-reliable old road bike, packed my backpack, and began heading north
                    up the Natchez Trace, no clear destination in mind.</p>

                <p>The Trace itself is 444 miles long, so I knew I wouldn't be completing it. I was not in cycling
                    shape and only brought one change of clothes. I was in this for the touring experience.</p>

                <p>I rode along the winding road, clouds overhead and a slight breeze. I was ready for the rain to
                    start at any moment, but it didn't. I made it all the way out to Port Gibson, where I exited
                    the Trace and looked for a place to stay.</p>

                <h3>The Plantation</h3>
                <p>There were no hotels in town, nor Airbnbs, but there was a listing for a bed and breakfast on
                    Google Maps. I called the number and sure enough, they had an opening for the night.</p>

                <p>I rode up to the address just as the rain started. And man, did it start. I also noticed that
                    the property was massive. What was this place? I met the owner and found out that it used to
                    be a plantation, but now it was owned by the descendants of the slaves who worked it. What a
                    cool story.</p>

                <p>I headed to my room, soaking wet, and crashed for the night.</p>

                <h3>The Ride Back</h3>
                <p>I woke up the next morning, ate breakfast with the plantation owner, and began my ride back to
                    the car. Cold and windy, and my butt hurt, but I made it back to Natchez and drove on back to
                    Houston.</p>
