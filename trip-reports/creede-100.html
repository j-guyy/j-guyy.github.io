            <h2>The Adventure</h2>
            <div class="trip-content">
                <p>Saturday at 8am, the airhorn went off. Maniacal laughter erupted from Crazy Chris, the race director.
                </p>

                <p>"There is no night in Creede," he would say.</p>

                <p>68 of us crossed the starting line. We didn't know this yet, but only 22 would return to cross the
                    finish line the following day.</p>

                <h3>Into the Alpine Unknown</h3>
                <p>The alpine environment is extremely unpredictable. When you're above the treeline, anything is fair
                    game for Mother Nature... That's the beauty of it.</p>

                <p>Through hail, rain, wind, sub-freezing temps at night, desert heat during the day, and a whole lot of
                    high elevation running, we pushed through. The mountains around this old mining town seemed
                    determined to test every ounce of resolve we had brought with us.</p>

                <h3>The Dark Hours</h3>
                <p>At 2am I mended my sopping, blistered, bloody feet. The damage was extensive, but there was no choice
                    but to continue. I got my dry clothes on and linked up with my pacer, Chris Davitt. My childhood
                    friend was pacing me through thousands of feet of climbing in the middle of the night. I was stoked.
                </p>

                <p>There is no night in Creede.</p>

                <p>Having someone familiar by my side as we navigated the technical terrain in darkness made all the
                    difference. Chris kept me moving when every fiber of my being wanted to stop, reminding me why I was
                    out there in the first place.</p>

                <h3>Dawn Above 13,000 Feet</h3>
                <p>We made it back over 13,000ft right at sunrise, and watching the stream of light progress across the
                    horizon gave me all the hope I needed. I was finishing this race.</p>

                <p>The sight was breathtaking - a reminder that sometimes the most beautiful moments come after the
                    darkest hours. The silver specks in the mountains around us caught the first rays of sunlight, and
                    for a moment, all the pain seemed worth it.</p>

                <h3>The Final Push</h3>
                <p>By the time I hit the final stretch, the sun was beginning to set on Sunday evening. I had been
                    running for the past 35 hours, smelled disgusting, hallucinated on multiple occasions, and was
                    tip-toeing the line of serious injury.</p>

                <p>But I was still moving forward. One foot in front of the other, just as I had been doing for over a
                    day and a half.</p>

                <h3>Victory</h3>
                <p>I crossed the finish line in 10th place overall. As I sat on the ground, ready to pass out, it
                    finally hit me. The most difficult event I've ever participated in was now behind me.</p>

                <p>I watched the sun set over town in sheer amazement. The silver specks in the mountains around this
                    old mining town seemed to hold their glimmer until the very last beam of sunlight faded.</p>

                <p>There is no night in Creede.</p>
